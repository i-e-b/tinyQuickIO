tinyQuickIO
===========

A conversion of https://github.com/SchwabenCode/QuickIO to reduce the code size. This is designed to be a more minimal project to be embedded into installers and similar tools.

A lot of the helpful interfaces, overloaded methods and meaningful exceptions are removed for the sake of code size.

This project will not follow changes to QuickIO.


Getting started
---------------

Look at the test suites for examples.
Most calls are based on the `NativeIO` static object in the `Minimal` namespace.
